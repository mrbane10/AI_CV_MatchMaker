# Auto CV MatchMaker

This is a Streamlit application that takes job descriptions and a candidate's resume, then evaluates if the candidate is a good fit for the job based on their qualifications. The application can take a CSV file containing multiple job description links or a single job description link, and a resume in PDF format. It generates a match result and creates a CSV output file if multiple job descriptions are provided.

## Features

- Upload the candidateâ€™s resume in PDF format.
